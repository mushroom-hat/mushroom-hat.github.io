title:  "Reverse Proxies & Load Balancers"
---

For one of my major projects in the module Network Security, my group of 6 was tasked to design and implement an enterprise network with appropriate security defenses. One of my contributions was the setting up on a reverse proxy server that served as a load balancer. I've always wondered how Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attacks can be mitigated. Fortunately, through the implementation of these mechanisms, I got to learn that a load balancer does exactly that!

## What is a Reverse Proxy?
Say you have an web server that needs to be accessed from the internet, however, you want to prevent direct access to this primary web server, perhaps for security reasons. A reverse proxy server could be set up that would essentially act as the gateway between the internet and your primary web server. Now, whenever the public wants to access the web application, the HTTP traffic would first reach the proxy server and the proxy server will subsequently forward the request to your primary server. This way, there is no need for direct access to the primary web server.

Additionally, you could also implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in this reverse proxy server that filters and logs the HTTP requests as the proxy server is now intercepting these requests. 

## What is a Load Balancer?
Simply put, a server with load balancing capabilities is able to distribute incoming traffic to a group of servers. Load balancers are typically implemented when the volume of incoming requests is too much for a single server to handle. As such, a group of servers (usually configured the same way) and a single load balancer will be deployed. Similar to a reverse proxy server, a load balancer will be the first point-of-contact between the client and the target server.

To put into perspective, isn't it amazing how the google server (www.google.com) is able to serve millions of requests a day? This is probably achievable due to a load balancer. A load balancer can help to limit and distribute requests from googlers to other backend servers that we are less aware of. 


With these ideas in mind, my group implemented the technologies mentioned as part of the security defenses for our enterprise network.
