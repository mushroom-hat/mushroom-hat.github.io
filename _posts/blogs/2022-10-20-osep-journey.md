It's done! I finally completed Offensive Security's penetration path. From the basics in PEN200 to the gruesome active directory sets in PEN300, i'm really thankful for this learning opportunity. Again, I truly believe Offensive Security has done many things right. One of them being the vision to spread knowledge and educate upcoming generations about cybersecurity.

On to the main post, if you are OSCP-certified and thinking whether or not you should invest in OSEP, you should! PEN300 is prepared in a way that PEN200 certified students can ease into it. Although, you would still time to invest time and effort into studying, understanding the codes provided and ultimately utilise them in your own penetration testing. Regardless, if you have the time and money, this course is extremely enriching.
