title:  "OSEP Journey!"
---

It's done! I finally completed Offensive Security's penetration path. From the basics in PEN200 to the gruesome active directory sets in PEN300, i'm really thankful for this learning opportunity. Again, I truly believe Offensive Security has done many things right. One of them being the vision to spread knowledge and educate upcoming generations about cybersecurity.

On to the main post, if you are OSCP-certified and thinking whether or not you should invest in OSEP, you should! PEN300 is prepared in a way that PEN200 certified students can ease into it. Although, you would still time to invest time and effort into studying, understanding the codes provided and ultimately utilise them in your own penetration testing. Regardless, if you have the time and money, this course is extremely enriching. 

In the screenshots below, you'll find the course topics. Some of which are really exciting such as active directory exploits and others (i.e., kiosk exploitation), perhaps not so much.

## The Journey
I started the PEN300 course in May 2022 with a 3 month package. This was immediately after my university finals as I was really excited about the course syllabus. I gotta admit that I got pretty complacent during the early stages of the course. It was definitely possible to finish the course content in a month as I had plenty of free time, but I did not. I went through about half the course content and had to suffer for the second and third month and I had start my internship at the organization I was bonded to. 

Unlike in OSCP where I had practiced in platforms such as Proving Grounds, the approach I took during PEN300 was rather different. The todo was to read/watch all course content before attempting the lab challenges. There were 6 lab challenges which test you on your understanding of the course materials. These lab challenges scale in difficulty with Challenge 1 being the easiest and Challenge 6 being rather...challenging. With my work commitments, I was barely extracting extra time for the lab challenges. Ultimately, my wallet suffer and I had to purchase a lab extension. The takeaway for anyone reading this section would be that: it is definitely possible to finish the course content + lab challenges in 3 months. Go at your own pace and absorb the course materials. 3 months is plenty of time if you're not complacent like me! After the completion of Challenge 6, i scheduled my exam in the next two weeks. I didn't really practice much during these two weeks as my university had started. 

## Exam Attempts 1 & 2
Yes, I took the exam twice and passed OSEP on the 2nd attempt.To pass OSEP, students have to find 10 flags (each consisting of 10 points), and in my first attempt, I bottlenecked at the 9th flag which was really unfortunately. I managed to pass on the second attempt with 13 flags! Both exam sets were different which really forces you into a new environment each time. In regards to sleep, I slept 11 hours in attempt 1 and 4 hours in attempt 2. I felt like I've aged 10 years at the end of the 48-hour exam. Not to mention I had to spend the next 24 hours writing the report. However, don't let this discourage you! It was fulfilling studying for a 300-level course, going through the exam sets and finally receiving the "Congratulations!""

The one thing I have learnt from both attempts, is to try harder and try everything. In some occasions, if exploit XXX failed once, I would give up testing the exploit. However, when I backtracked and went back to test the exploit a second time (hours later), it would work! 

## What's Next
In my OSCP Journey post, I stated that I wanted to tackle PEN300 after PEN200. I'm really glad to say that I have fulfilled this goal. Moving forward, since I have one month of university holidays in December 2022, I have plans to develop a chained active directory set that incorporates various penetration testing methodologies and MITRE framework. The objective of this mini project would be to contribute back to Offensive Security for [User-Generated Content](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/submit/). Additionally, along the way, I'd get to teach myself the intricacies of machine design and box development :).
