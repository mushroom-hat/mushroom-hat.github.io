title:  "OSEP Journey!"
---

I mentioned in my OSCP Journey post that I wanted to tackle PEN300 after completing PEN200. I'm happy to share that I've completed this task. It's done! I completed Offensive Security's penetration path. From the basics in PEN200 (OSCP) to the gruesome active directory sets in PEN300, i'm really thankful for this learning opportunity. Again, I truly believe Offensive Security has done many things right. One of them being the vision to spread knowledge and educate upcoming generations about cybersecurity through quality challenges.

## What PEN300 is
In the screenshots below, you'll find the course topics. Some of which are really exciting such as active directory exploitation & advanced antivirus evasions and others (i.e., kiosk breakouts), perhaps not so much.

PEN300 teaches advanced penetration testing in active directory environments, as well as red team skills such as phishing attacks. If you have spent enough time studying for OSCP and are now OSCP certified, I believe you are ready for OSEP. PEN300 is designed in such a way that PEN200 certified students can transition smoothly into it. However, you would still need to invest time and effort in studying, understanding, and ultimately implementing the provided codes in your own penetration testing. Furthermore, if you're wondering if C# knowledge is **required**, I personally didn't have much prior C# experience but was able to read and understand code.


## The Journey
In May 2022, I began the PEN300 course with a three-month package. This was right after my university finals, and I was ecstatic about the course syllabus. I have to admit that I became quite complacent in the early stages of the course. I could have finished the course content in a month because I had so much free time, but I didn't. I completed roughly half of the course content and had to struggle for the second and third months due to the start of an internship that I had ongoing.

Unlike in OSCP, where I practiced on platforms like Proving Grounds, my approach during PEN300 was quite different. Before attempting the lab challenges, the todo was to read/watch all course content. There were six lab challenges that tested your knowledge of the course materials. The difficulty of these lab challenges varies, with Challenge 1 being the easiest and Challenge 6 being rather...challenging. With my work obligations, I was barely making time for the lab challenges. Unexpectedly, my wallet suffered, and I had to buy a lab extension. 

The takeaway for anyone reading this section would be that: it is definitely possible to finish the course content + lab challenges in 3 months. 3 months is plenty of time if you're not complacent like me! After the completion of Challenge 6, i scheduled my exam in two weeks. During these two weeks, I didn't really practice much as my university had started at around this time. 

## Exam Attempts 1 & 2
Yes, I took the exam twice and passed on the second try. To pass OSEP, students must find 10 flags (each flag is worth 10 points), and unfortunately, I bottlenecked at the 9th flag on my first attempt. I passed the second time around with 13 flags! Both exam sets were distinct, putting you in a new environment each time. With regards to sleep, in attempt 1, I slept 11 hours and in attempt 2, I slept 4 hours. 

At the end of the 48-hour exam, I felt like I'd aged ten years! Not to mention the fact that I needed to spend the next 24 hours writing the report. However, don't let this discourage you. It was fulfilling studying for a 300-level course, going through the exam sets and finally receiving the "Congratulations!"

The one thing I have learnt from both attempts, is to try harder and try everything. In some occasions, if exploit XXX failed once, I would give up testing the exploit. However, when I backtracked and went back to test the exploit a second time (hours later), it would work! 

## Is course material enough?
Well...yes, and no. Everything covered in the course materials, in my opinion, is sufficient. However, in order to succeed in PEN300, you will need to use your OSCP methodologies. This course will provide you with advanced content, but you will ultimately have to put the pieces together and use critical thinking during the exam. When compared to their course materials, Offsec's exams are always more difficult.

## What's Next
Moving forward, I intend to create a chained active directory set that incorporates various penetration testing methodologies and the MITRE framework, as I have one month of university holidays in December 2022. The goal of this mini project is to give back to Offensive Security in the form of [User-Generated Content](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/submit/). Along the way, I'd get to learn the intricacies of machine design and box development:).
