## Android Application Obfuscator
For this project, my team of 6 members were tasked to develop an obfuscator program to obfuscate Android applications. As you may know, Android applications are written using Java/Kotlin and these source codes are compiled into Dalvik Executables (.dex) which are essentially executable code for Android. These low  level code can be converted (using tools) to a more readable code, also known as smali code. For this project, my team developed a program that can successfully obfuscate the application at a higher level (i.e., java/kotlin) and byte code at a lower level (i.e., smali).

## Mobile Malware
I took a module called "Mobile Security" during the second trimester of my year one studies at SIT. I created a mobile application that appeared to be harmless but is actually mobile malware. From this assignment, I learned about various mobile permissions, how data is stored in Android/IOS, and many other things. Despite the fact that our team constructed a relatively simple malware that tries to steal personal information, we were unable to obtain any higher privileges (i.e., root). Having said that, we focused the majority of our efforts on the data exfiltration process, including setting up our own cloud servers, writing custom socket code, and not forgetting encryption! Using both RSA and AES encryption techniques, we were able to properly encrypt the information passed from the victim to our C2. This project would not have been possible without the contributions of my teammates, especially because we were one member short compared to the other teams. I may be exposed to writing more mobile viruses or applications in the future, and I will undoubtedly tap on this experience.
