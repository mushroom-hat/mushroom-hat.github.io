Hello there, it's mushroom hat. I'm an Information Security student who created this blog to document some of my thoughts, mostly cybersecurity related. Fond of human psychology and solving problems using technology. 

A friend of mine used to call me "mushroom" due to my hairstyle and it's kinda stuck with me since. The second part of my name comes from the fact that I wear multiple hats for my profession!
