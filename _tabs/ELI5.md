## Explain Like I'm 5
Welcome to this page where I will try my best to explain technical ideas and concepts in a way that a 5-year-old can understand! For the audiences, I hope this page helps you in understanding some concepts which might be difficult to grasp initially. For myself, I am using this as practice for explaining technical information to non-technical audiences!
